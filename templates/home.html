        <p class="col-md-10 fs-4">As a data analyst in the healthcare industry, I’ve had the privilege of leveraging
            data to improve patient outcomes and drive meaningful change. Over time, I’ve developed a passion for
            technology and its ability to solve complex problems on a larger scale. I want to transition into the tech
            space to expand my impact, apply my analytical skills to innovative projects, and contribute to building
            solutions that shape the future.</p>
